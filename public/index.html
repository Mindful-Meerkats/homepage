                          A small team of sustainable & web developers has taken up the challenge to transform the passive majority of individuals in western societies into active and mindful citizens. "Mindful Meerkats" is the name of our idea to design a game that provides the majority of people with incentives to reflect upon their individual behaviour and engage in more sustainable lifestyles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We distinguish four different types of people (see attached .gif animation) that we want to reach and inspire for sustainability. They all have different reasons not to become engaged with sustainability by themselves:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The Ignorant is aware of the problem of unsustainabilities but does not see any reason to act. In the game he needs to be addressed by game actions that enhance his personal well-being whilst simultaneously stimulating positive effects for his socio-environmental surrounding;</li>
                          <li>The Unaware is not even aware of the problem. In the game he needs to be addressed by positive (stimuli) game actions that let him reflect on his own contribution to the problem;</li>
                          <li>The Unknowledgable is aware of the problem but does not know any solution to act upon. In the game he needs to be addressed by game actions that provide him with knowledge to act more mindful in the future;</li>
                          <li>The Delegator is aware of the problem, might even know a solution, but delegates the responsibility to third-parties, e.g. the government. In the game he needs to be addressed by game actions that empower his actions and show him how easy it is to contribute to a sustainable change;</li>
                        </ul>
